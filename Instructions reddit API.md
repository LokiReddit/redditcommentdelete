You need a client ID and client secret to run the program. This assumes you already have a reddit account. 
To use Reddit's API, you need to create a developer application on Reddit. Follow these steps:

a. Log in to your Reddit account.

b. Visit https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

c. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App" at the bottom of the page.

d. Fill out the form:
- Choose "script" for the application type.
- Give it a name and description.
- For "redirect uri," enter "http://localhost:8080".
- Click "Create App".

e. Note the "client_id" (the string below the app name) and "client_secret" to plug into the code.
