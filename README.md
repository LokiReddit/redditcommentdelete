This code is a Python script that uses the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to delete comments made by a Reddit user. The user must provide their own client ID, client secret, Reddit username, and Reddit password.

The script first retrieves a list of subreddits that the user has commented in, along with the number of comments made in each subreddit. It then prompts the user to select a subreddit to review and delete comments from.

If there are fewer than 10 comments in the selected subreddit, the script shows all comments and prompts the user to confirm whether they want to delete all comments in the subreddit. If the user confirms, the script proceeds to delete all comments in the subreddit.

If there are more than 10 comments in the selected subreddit, the script sorts the comments by score and presents them to the user one at a time, prompting the user to decide whether to delete each comment or skip it. The user can also choose to go back to a previous comment, restart the review for the subreddit, or quit the script entirely.

After the review of the selected subreddit is complete, the script prompts the user to either restart the review process for another subreddit or quit the script entirely.
